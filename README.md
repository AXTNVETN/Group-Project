# Group-Project
This repo will contain the entirety of the tasks the will be made in the module 200


## Commit guide
Here are the commit message types we should try to write:

- fix   : for fixes of already added features / core mechanics
- feat  : for implementation of features (kind of reserved for the first time a feature is pushed)
- chore : updates or changes that are arbitrary (changing the size of something for example, if its not for fixing something)
- perf  : performance or optimisation changes
- other : anything else

### Examples:

    fix: commits, trim long messages to 72

    feat: issue filter, add option to filter by reviewer

    fix: notifications, actually mark as read when dismissing

    chore: foolib, upgrade to 1.2.3

    perf: comments, index on author makes search 2x faster
